# <ins>Cats and Dogs CNN Classification</ins>
## About:
This is a trained model which will classify between cats and dogs. The project can be accessed [here](https://cats-dogs.streamlit.app/) - deployed on Streamlit 

I have used Python (in a Jupyter Notebook & a raw Python file) + incorporated Streamlit code + CSS styling in 'st.markdown', edited in Microsoft VS Code.
## How To Use:
Click the button that will direct you to your files where you will upload an image, which the model will say is a cat or a dog.

Time spent: 8 hours 59 mins https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U07UMUZA24A/cats_dogs_ml https://hackatime-badge.hackclub.com/U07UMUZA24A/cats_vs_dogs

## Credits:
- Most of the code making the model was from [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENXr1foShrA&t=169s)
- ChatGPT did help me with errors with installing some of the python libraries + issues with CSS styling
